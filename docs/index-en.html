                    <h3>Scientific Research and Undergraduate Research</h3>
                    <p>Over 3 years of experience in Undergraduate Research in air quality, working with the NAPI - EC research group (New Research and Innovation Arrangements â€“ Climate Emergency). Conducted analyses of atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in Ponta Grossa (PR), public health data in SÃ£o Paulo (SP), and atmospheric pollen data.
                        <br/>
                        Contributed to the research group by developing R scripts for collection and exploratory analysis of health data from the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and collaborated on implementing LSTM neural networks.
                        <br/>
                        In the final year of the project, implemented artificial neural networks to predict atmospheric pollen concentration in Curitiba (PR). Although the model was not applied due to time-series limitations, the methodology formed the basis of the undergraduate thesis (TCC), applying the same network to three pollen types â€” (<i>Ambrosia</i>, <i>Betula</i>, and Grasses) â€” from the Croatian-Serbian region (RealForAll project data).
                        <br/>
